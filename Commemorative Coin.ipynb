    "\n",
    "## The Coin\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a detailed report into [the 75th Anniversary Commemorative Coin](https://www.asd.gov.au/75th-anniversary/events/2022-09-01-75th-anniversary-commemorative-coin) released by the Royal Australian Mint in conjunction/partnership with the Australian Signals Directorate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Me\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been using Python semi-regularly for about a year now, and I'm slowly integrating it into my work. I've recently started a Graduate Certificate in Data Science, so while I don't have the domain-specific knowledge, the process is the kind of thing I'm comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About This\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a bit of a learning exercise, and hopefully some other people find it useful/interesting. I've recently been trying to improve in certain aspects, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* code layout, legibliity\n",
    "* proper commenting, docstrings\n",
    "* overall style consistency\n",
    "* type hinting, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure there will be things where I've either done too much or too little, but with experience, I'll understand the best balance I suppose ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't really have a good grasp on cryptography beyond some fairly basic knowledge, so this involved a fair bit of Googling. The further and more specific I got, the more relevant the results were to this specific challenge. A couple of times, I accidentally started reading answers or explanations before I had a chance to work it out for myself. I stopped reading when I realised, but it definitely prodded me in the right direction, so for better or worse it saved me a lot of time and frustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say, this notebook is jam-packed full of **SPOILERS!** **SPOILERS!** **SPOILERS!** **SPOILERS!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Seriously, resist reading this if you want to solve it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've never used git or GitHub before either, terrible I know, so mistakes will be made. I feel like there should be some sort of disclaimer. All the images are referenced from the links given, the ASCII one is from PC Mag, and the rest shamelessly stolen from the ASD website. Err that's covered under fair use, right...?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary Research\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally found out about this through an ABC News article, and the first thing I did was try to find some more information online, eg.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Guardian article by Emily Wind](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/01/amateur-code-breakers-challenged-to-decipher-secret-messages-on-australian-coin)\n",
    "* [Video from ASD about the recent Decoded exhibition](https://www.asd.gov.au/75th-anniversary/events/2022-04-01-decoded-exhibition-national-museum-australia) at the National Museum of Australia\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "The article ended up being useful to steer me in the right direction, and the following quotes implied that the ciphers would be ordered chronologically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *\"“We have used that part of our history in different layers, which represents the progress of encryption and technology throughout 75 years,” Noble said.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *\"There are clues on both sides of the coin, and those with a general understanding of encryption and coding will safely make it through to the last layer, which requires a computer.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, I tried to determine what I should be looking for, and I found the following quotes useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *\"“Though some coding for the coin originated with the Roman empire, there is remarkably still a place for them in modern intelligence,” Noble said.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *\"One layer is inspired by the coding technology used during the second world war by ASD personnel, in which pencil and paper was used to decode Japanese military codes. These were then re-encoded and sent out to allies, letting them know where Japanese war fighters were.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *\"It combines codes thousands of years old through to modern binary code invented during the age of computing.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "I got the *Accessible text version* on Friday evening from [this page on the ASD website](https://www.asd.gov.au/75th-anniversary/events/2022-09-01-75th-anniversary-commemorative-coin). Based on a preliminary look and a bit of inuition, it seemed to give some indication as to the order of the ciphers:\n",

    "# Chronological Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "So it looks like all the ciphers are in some sort of chronological order. I had questions whether the Queen's Head code technically was one of the challenges, or if it was simply an entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excluding this, taken in the order from 2-5 on the ASD page, we come to a roughly consistent chronology again:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outer Ring - Atbash cipher - Ancient world\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outer Ring - Morse encoding - 19th Century\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inner Ring - Transposition cipher - World War 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inner Ring - Seven-bit ASCII - early digital era\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inner One Third - Eight-bit ASCII - later digital era\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, the seven-bit ASCII also has the Atbash cipher applied to it, but never let the truth get in the way of a good ~~story~~ chronology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the correct number of codes, the simplest answer is either the Queen's Head code isn't counted, or these last two count as one. But maybe *'five'* was a red herring all along, and they've actually started counting at zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "I find this second answer amusing, which is why I've numbered the sections starting at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that was an interesting distraction from my uni work. It's always been my intention to learn more about cryptography, but I've never done anything like this before.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that one of my weaknesses is getting stuck in an assumption or preconception about something. Attempting to get the correct result based off an incorrect assumption leads to a lot of frustration, so I need to learn to break out of that, try something new or play devil's advocate a bit more."
